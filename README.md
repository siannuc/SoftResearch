# SoftResearch

In order to validate the deflections and measurements of the created soft actuators, a program is needed to obtain three dimensional postional values of the soft actuator. 

A RealSense D415 is used to obtain depth from the postional markings. 

To get the code to run, press and hold 'k' to start the loop which initalizes the ability to obtain positional values for 2 clicked pixels on the window.
